    <h1 id="demo1">ABOUT EVM</h1>
    <h1 id="demo">An Electronic Voting Machine (EVM) is a modern device used to facilitate and streamline the voting process in elections. It replaces the traditional paper ballot system with a digital interface to record and count votes. The EVM consists of two main components: the Control Unit, which is operated by election officials to oversee and manage the voting process, and the Ballot Unit, which voters use to cast their votes by selecting candidates through a set of buttons. Designed to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of voting, EVMs reduce the likelihood of errors and fraud, and speed up the counting process. Additionally, they incorporate various security features to protect the integrity of the electoral system.</h1>
